## Projects

Explore my data analysis and visualization projects from SDS192!

### Scorecard Analysis

-   This project explores how the percentage of STEM and business degrees at colleges impacts long-term income and tuition costs. Findings show that while schools offering more of these degrees have higher tuition, graduates tend to earn significantly more. However, the affordability for low-income students remains a growing challenge. [View Project](projects/project-1-sabzara-alex/scorecard_analysis.qmd)

### FEC Analysis

-   This analysis dives into the relationship between campaign contributions and election outcomes in New Jersey's 2016 U.S. House race. While winning candidates received higher contributions, especially from lobbyist committees, the data shows that multiple factors—such as committee type and political environment—play crucial roles in determining electoral success.

### Mapping Chipotle Stores

-   Here, I analyzed the distribution of Chipotle restaurants across the U.S., correlating it with state populations. By adjusting for population density, I found that Chipotle strategically places its locations in high-density urban areas while balancing store density in smaller states.
