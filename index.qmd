### ***FEC Analysis***

-   This analysis highlights the complex relationship between campaign contributions and election outcomes in New Jersey’s 2016 U.S. House race.

### ***Mapping Chipotle Stores***

-   This project analyzed the distribution of Chipotle restaurants across the U.S. and their correlation with state populations. By comparing store counts to population density and adjusting for population size, we found that Chipotle strategically concentrates locations in high-density urban areas while maintaining a balanced store density in smaller states.
