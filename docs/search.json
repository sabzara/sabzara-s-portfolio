To gain deeper insights, we adjust the analysis by calculating the number of Chipotle stores per million residents in each state. By visualizing this proportion, we account for population differences, allowing us to see which states have more stores per million residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog Post\nIn this project, we explored the distribution of Chipotle restaurants across the United States using geospatial analysis. Leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, which provides the location of every Chipotle restaurant in the country, we sought to understand the company’s location strategy. The dataset was uploaded by Jeffrey Braun, a UChicago graduate, who claimed to have scraped the data from the Chipotle website. (Braun 2020). Specifically, we aimed to analyze how Chipotle store locations are distributed in relation to state populations and to investigate whether store concentration correlates with population density.\nWe began by visualizing the locations of Chipotle restaurants on a U.S. map. This involved converting the dataset into a spatial format, enabling us to plot the coordinates of each store. The visualization revealed that Chipotle locations are primarily concentrated in urban centers, with states like California, New York, and Texas hosting the most stores. These states, with their high population densities and large urban hubs like Los Angeles, New York City, and Houston, naturally align with a higher number of Chipotle locations. To assess how population influences store distribution, we created a population map of the United States. This step was crucial as it provided a baseline for comparing the distribution of Chipotle locations to population data. From there, we developed a custom function to calculate each state’s proportion of Chipotle stores relative to the national total. Using this data, we created a choropleth map that graphically represented the store proportions, offering a clear depiction of states with higher or lower concentrations of Chipotle locations. The resulting map closely mirrored the population map, suggesting that states with larger populations generally host more Chipotle stores. However, we wanted to investigate further to determine if less-populated states had a comparable number of stores per million residents to more populous states.\nWe then took our analysis a step further by considering population-adjusted metrics. Recognizing that absolute store counts alone do not account for state population differences, we integrated U.S. Census data to calculate the number of Chipotle stores per million residents in each state. This approach allowed us to explore whether smaller states with lower populations had comparable store density to larger, more populous states. Using this new proportion, we created another choropleth map to visualize the distribution of Chipotle stores on a per-capita basis, offering a more balanced view of store density relative to population size. The population-adjusted analysis highlights interesting patterns. States with, such as Minnesota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, have a proportionally higher number of Chipotle stores per capita, even if their total store counts are relatively modest. On the other hand, some highly populated states have a relatively lower store density per capita, despite hosting a large number of locations overall. This suggests that Chipotle’s placement strategy is not solely driven by population size but also considers other factors such as high-traffic urban centers, economic activity, and potentially regional preferences.\nOur findings align with insights from Jordan Bean’s study, which highlights Chipotle’s strategic focus on urban centers in high-density areas while also noting a recent shift toward suburban areas (Bean 2023). This strategic adaptation may reflect evolving trends, such as population migration and hybrid work patterns, as Chipotle seeks to expand its reach into new markets.\nIn conclusion, this project highlights the value of integrating geospatial and demographic analysis to understand business strategies. By creating maps that account for both absolute store counts and population-adjusted metrics, we uncovered patterns that reveal the brand’s strategic focus on urban areas and densely populated states. These findings can help inform business decisions of Chipotle and other brands, from identifying growth opportunities to refining location strategies. Lastly, this project highlights how geospatial tools and demographic data in R can be applied to real-world problems, offering practical insights for optimizing retail operations and enhancing strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBean, Jordan. 2023. “Beyond the Burrito: The Analytics Behind Chipotle’s Location Strategy.” Medium, May. https://jordanbean.medium.com/the-analytics-behind-chipotles-location-strategy-2d91a23fd66.\n\n\nBraun, Jeffrey. 2020. “Chipotle Locations: A CSV File for All Chipotle Locations in the US.” https://www.kaggle.com/jeffreybraun/chipotle-locations."

    "text": "Understanding Datasets\nWe started by reading the Data Dictionary carefully. We used variables from the data dictionary to create a new “STEM_Business” variable, representing the percentage of degrees offered in STEM and business. A bar graph was generated, with the x-axis limited to selected institutions using scale_x_discrete. We ensured consistency by selecting schools of similar size as count_wne_inc3_10 gave us number of students earning in high-income brackets. Labels were clarified by mutating “University of Massachusetts-Boston” to “UMASS Boston” and applying coord_flip for readability. Finally, we used geom_bar for creating bar graph and geom_point for scatter plots\n\n\nVisualization Aesthetics\nAdjusting the graphs to present better visually demonstrate our fluency of visualization aesthetics. For example, for the bar plot we used colors that clearly displayed the variation in earnings, and we used varying colors between the trend-line and the scatter plot to clearly display the trend. We also used concise names for the graphs, and make sure to include subtitles and captions to space out information clearly.\n\n\nPlotting Frequencies and Distributions\nPlotting the distributions along the scatter plot and determining which data to use demonstrated our knowledge and plotting frequencies and distributions. For example, when debating just plotting the schools we used in our bar plot or a larger range, we decided that using all MA institutions with provided data would show a more realistic distribution of data compared to a handpicked group of institutions."

    "text": "The College Scorecard project was developed by the U.S. Department of Education, including insights into the cost, performance, and outcomes of colleges, allowing users to weigh trade-offs and make informed decisions based on their educational needs and goals. The data is derived from multiple sources, including institutional reports through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). All the variables selected for the given visualizations come from IPEDS. IPEDS gathers information from every institution that participates in the federal student financial aid programs. For this project, we are working to explore the relationship between the percentage of business degrees offered, the cost of attending various schools, and the number of students in high-income brackets ten years after enrolling in school and not currently enrolled. Specifically, we sought to understand how financially affordable schools with a focus on STEM degrees are and whether attending these institutions increases the likelihood of graduates achieving higher income levels. For the bar graph, the percentage of STEM and business degrees offered by each institution were compared with that with the number of students who, 10 years after entry, are earning in the highest income bracket (≥ $75,001). For the scatter plot, the percentage of degrees awarded in STEM and business were compared with the cost to attend each institution. The range for degrees awarded is from 0% to 100%. The range for the cost to attend per academic year is from $0 per year to $80,000 per year. The first bar plot analyzes the STEM_Business variable. A distinct trend emerges: institutions that award a higher percentage of degrees in STEM and business fields are associated with a greater number of students earning over $75,000 ten years after enrollment. Specifically, institutions with more than 40% of degrees in these disciplines report over 500 individuals in the high-income bracket, whereas those with lower percentages of STEM and business degrees have fewer than 300 high-income earners. This finding suggests graduates from STEM- and business-focused schools have better financial prospects, suggesting these paths boost long-term earning potential.\nThe scatter plot determines that the percentage of degrees awarded in STEM and business has a positive relationship with the cost to attend each institution. This is emphasized by the trendline. Schools with a heavy emphasis on the humanities, producing close to zero percentage of degrees awarded in STEM and business, cost a median of $17,000 per academic year. This is converse schools with a heavy emphasis on STEM and business, producing a close to 100% of degrees awarded in STEM and business cost a median of about $69,000 per year.\nThe above analysis indicates that low-income individuals have limited access to institutions offering STEM and business degrees, while students attending these schools tend to achieve higher income levels. The higher costs associated with STEM programs may exacerbate income inequality, making it difficult for lower-income students to pursue these fields and improve their financial prospects. This highlights a path for policymakers to address educational and economic inequity by improving access to STEM and business programs for low-income students However, ethical concerns must be acknowledged. We did not examine whether these institutions provide federal aid, which could impact access for low-income students. It is also possible that students from higher-income families attend these schools and achieve higher incomes because of their background. Their financial success may not solely be attributed to their STEM and business degrees. Our dataset focuses primarily on institutions with mid-high enrollment sizes in Massachusetts, particularly in the Boston region, which may not fully represent trends at smaller LACs. This analysis may unintentionally marginalize institutions offering strong employment prospects in non-STEM fields, potentially overlooking viable career paths for diverse student populations."

Descriptions can be found on FEC: https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/transaction-type-code-descriptions/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog post\nWe used the fec16 package, which contains data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for the 2015-2016 U.S. election cycle. We utilized the following datasets from the fec16.\n\nCommittees: Information on committees registered with the FEC, detailing their affiliations and financial activities.\nCampaigns: Data on U.S. House and Senate campaigns, including candidate details and campaign expenditures.\nResults_house: Election results for the 2016 U.S. House of Representatives race, including vote counts and candidate information.\nContributions: A sample dataset of contributions from committees to candidates during the 2016 cycle.\n\nOur analysis examined how money contributed by committees to candidates and spent in campaigns for or against candidates affected election results for the U.S. House of Representatives in New Jersey.\nAt first, we performed an inner join on the committees, contributions, and house results datasets. Our analysis revealed that winning candidates received $11,460 K from candidate committees. ( about two times more) while losing candidates received only about $ 5,400 K . The contributions to winning candidates were predominantly from Lobbyist/Registrant PACs (over two-third), followed by substantial funding from Unauthorized committees. In contrast, losing candidates had primarily relied on Unauthorized Committees followed by minimal amounts from Leadership PACs and Lobbyist/Registrant PACs.\nIn joining the sample dataset “contributions” with the full datasets of “campaigns” and “results_house”, and then filtering the results to New Jersey, We were able to find the contributions given to all candidates for the NJ House of Representatives and their results in the 2016 election. A pattern found by the dataset is that candidates that were elected often received multiple types of contributions. It is worth noting that one of the contribution types of this dataset also includes contributions that were made against those candidates. However, the candidates that were elected often had several different contribution types, so even if one was against the candidate, the others would outweigh it.\nOur analysis shows that candidates who received higher contributions from committees were more likely to succeed in the 2016 House elections in New Jersey. A significant portion of these contributions came from lobbyist committees, suggesting they may influence elections by supporting preferred candidates. However, the data does not account for other factors, such as New Jersey’s Democratic-leaning political environment, which could partially explain the funding patterns. While the data shows a correlation between funding and election success, we cannot assume a direct cause. Other factors, such as the type of committee and the political affiliations of contributors, likely influenced the results. When joining data from different sources, it is crucial to consider the context and relationships between variables. Focusing solely on campaign contributions without acknowledging the broader political dynamics could lead to misleading conclusions. We must account for all variables and their interrelationships to avoid creating a misleading or incomplete picture.This highlights the importance of ethical data analysis: we must recognize the limitations of the datasets and avoid drawing oversimplified or false conclusions."

In the first code, we grouped the data by the won status and used the summarize function along with sum to calculate the total contributions given to each candidate. The use of group_by allowed us to separate and compare the total contributions for winning and losing candidates, helping us analyze if the overall funds are distributed more to candidates who win the election.\n\n\nJoining Data\nWe joined three datasets—contributions, committees, and results_house—to create the first table and contributions, campaigns and results_house in second table. Since we wanted to analyze how much funding was contributed to winning and losing candidates, and identify the type of committee making the contributions, we used an inner join to ensure that all candidates in our dataset had complete information on all three aspects. We first joined the contributions and results_house datasets by cand_id, which allowed us to associate the contributions with the candidates and their election outcomes in the House of Representatives. Next, we joined these joined datasets to committees dataset by cmte_id to identify the types of committees that were contributing to the candidates.

    "text": "Blog Post\nThe College Scorecard project was developed by the U.S. Department of Education, including insights into the cost, performance, and outcomes of colleges, allowing users to weigh trade-offs and make informed decisions based on their educational needs and goals. The data is derived from multiple sources, including institutional reports through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). All the variables selected for the given visualizations come from IPEDS. IPEDS gathers information from every institution that participates in the federal student financial aid programs. For this project, we are working to explore the relationship between the percentage of business degrees offered, the cost of attending various schools, and the number of students in high-income brackets ten years after enrolling in school and not currently enrolled. Specifically, we sought to understand how financially affordable schools with a focus on STEM degrees are and whether attending these institutions increases the likelihood of graduates achieving higher income levels. For the bar graph, the percentage of STEM and business degrees offered by each institution were compared with that with the number of students who, 10 years after entry, are earning in the highest income bracket (≥ $75,001). For the scatter plot, the percentage of degrees awarded in STEM and business were compared with the cost to attend each institution. The range for degrees awarded is from 0% to 100%. The range for the cost to attend per academic year is from $0 per year to $80,000 per year.\nThe first bar plot analyzes the STEM_Business variable. A distinct trend emerges: institutions that award a higher percentage of degrees in STEM and business fields are associated with a greater number of students earning over $75,000 ten years after enrollment. Specifically, institutions with more than 40% of degrees in these disciplines report over 500 individuals in the high-income bracket, whereas those with lower percentages of STEM and business degrees have fewer than 300 high-income earners. This finding suggests graduates from STEM- and business-focused schools have better financial prospects, suggesting these paths boost long-term earning potential.\nThe scatter plot determines that the percentage of degrees awarded in STEM and business has a positive relationship with the cost to attend each institution. This is emphasized by the trendline. Schools with a heavy emphasis on the humanities, producing close to zero percentage of degrees awarded in STEM and business, cost a median of $17,000 per academic year. This is converse schools with a heavy emphasis on STEM and business, producing a close to 100% of degrees awarded in STEM and business cost a median of about $69,000 per year.\nThe above analysis indicates that low-income individuals have limited access to institutions offering STEM and business degrees, while students attending these schools tend to achieve higher income levels. The higher costs associated with STEM programs may exacerbate income inequality, making it difficult for lower-income students to pursue these fields and improve their financial prospects. This highlights a path for policymakers to address educational and economic inequity by improving access to STEM and business programs for low-income students However, ethical concerns must be acknowledged. We did not examine whether these institutions provide federal aid, which could impact access for low-income students. It is also possible that students from higher-income families attend these schools and achieve higher incomes because of their background. Their financial success may not solely be attributed to their STEM and business degrees. Our dataset focuses primarily on institutions with mid-high enrollment sizes in Massachusetts, particularly in the Boston region, which may not fully represent trends at smaller LACs. This analysis may unintentionally marginalize institutions offering strong employment prospects in non-STEM fields, potentially overlooking viable career paths for diverse student populations."

This may involve assigning someone to check in with team members that are falling behind, establishing expectations for attending office hours and asking for help, calling team meetings to discuss issues, or reaching out to the instructor to resolve enduring and unresolved conflicts."
